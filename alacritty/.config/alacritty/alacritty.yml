  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for

# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the

# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.

#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart
